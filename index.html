      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The JavaScript global environment defined in this specification allows
        web developers to author applications that manage the application
        lifecycle and react to system events. These capabilities
        allow application developers to create applications that integrate
        closely with the underlying system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the APIs defined in this specification, an application is
        able to run application logic independently of any user interface
        scripts and react to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changes in the application lifecycle such as launch and terminate
          (<a href="#application-events">application events</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Events sent by the system (<a href="#system-events">system events</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Scheduled wakeup calls
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!--
      <div class="note">
        The examples below are not up-to-date.
      </div>
      <p>
        The manifest (<code>manifest.json</code>) states which file is used
        to represent the <a>main document</a>.
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
        {
          'main': { 'scripts': ['main.js'] } // TODO: should we allow registering a service worker via manifest?
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <a>main document</a> has the ability to listen to the
        launch event and for instance create a window.
        It is also possible to access the document for the window
        which was created.
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
        runtime.onlaunch = function() {
          // Create a window for a given url.
          runtime.<a href="app-windowing.html#idl-def-ApplicationRuntime">createWindow</a>('main_ui.html').fulfill(function(win) {
            // Get the document for the window resource.
            var doc = win.contentWindow.document;
            // Set the baz variable on the document associated with the created window resource.
            doc.baz = 'Hello from app';
          });
        };
      </pre>
      <p>
        Alternatively, if the author wants to show the window only when all
        content and referenced resources have been loaded, it is possible to
        initially hide the constructed window and inspect the document 
        readiness on the newly constructed window.
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
        runtime.onlaunch = function() {
          // Create an initially hidden window for a given url.
          var options = { hidden: true };
          runtime.<a href="app-windowing.html#idl-def-ApplicationRuntime">createWindow</a>('main_ui.html', options).fulfill(function(win) {

              // Get the document for the window resource.
              var doc = win.contentWindow.document;

              // Show the window when all content has loaded, incl. images.
              if (doc.readyState == "complete") {
                win.show();
              } else {
                doc.onreadystatechange = function() {
                  if (doc.readyState == "complete") {
                    win.show();
                  }
                };
              }
            }
          );
        };
      </pre>
      <div class="note">
        Simplify the above example for better ergonomics. Is there a way to avoid
        needing two branches, e.g. could we invoke fulfill callback only after
        the <code>readyState</code> is set to <code>complete</code>
        (this needs to be specified)?

          A Single Entry Point to the Application
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <a>main document</a> is the main entry point of the application
          to the system. When loading the <a>main document</a>, the runtime
          does not display it to the user. If the application intends to show a user
          interface it has to create windows or interact with the platform
          in other ways such as by using a notification system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The runtime can unload the <a>main document</a> in certain circumstances,
          which results in termination of the application. When the
          <a>main document</a> is not executing any script, has no pending
          callbacks, and no open windows, the runtime can decide to unload the
          <a>main document</a>. In addition, the runtime unloads the <a>main
          document</a> in order to reduce resource consumption.
          For example, after loading the <a>main document</a> and no window is
          visible, the application can be terminated by the runtime.

          Behavior Adaptation at Launch

          This section is non-normative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The runtime does not create any visible windows by itself when
          launching an application. This is up to the application
          and is handled as part of the <em>launch</em> event.
          When launched, the application will know the reason for the
          launch. The reason could be a scheduled wake up, a persistent
          event of interest or a direct launch either by the system,
          another application, or initiated by the user. This allows the
          application to act differently depending on the reason.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>System Event-initiated Launch</h3>
          <p>
            The runtime starts the application for the purpose of
            delivering events from the system. For example, a system-level
            service might ask an email application to send an email on its
            behalf. To handle these cases, the runtime will listen to
            system events in order to launch the <a>main document</a> in
            response to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            An application subscribes to system events either at
            install time or at runtime. 
          </p>
        </section>

          <h3>Wakeup-initiated Launch</h3>

          </p>
          <p>
            An application can schedule itself for wake-up by scheduling
            a task. A task will ensure that the application is
            running and that the launch event has been fired at the <a>main
            document</a> before resolving the the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that in order to run a task at the scheduled time,
            the application can be started a bit earlier.

          Termination Sequence
        </h2>
        <p>
          This section is non-normative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The runtime terminates the application if it becomes idle
          or in case of resource constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before actual termination, the <em>terminate</em> event 
          is sent, giving the application the ability to clear up,
          store state and close windows. In case that the application 
          does not terminate within a given time, the runtime can
          consider the application as too slow or hanging and has the
          ability to terminate it immediately (forced termination).
          The application can save its state periodically to
          protect against data loss, in such a case.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the <em>terminate event</em>, or in case of forced
          termination, the runtime will progress to actual termination,
          which at least includes closing all remaining windows and
          unloading of the <a>main document</a>. What other resources the
          runtime unloads is up to the implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an exception as the application can receive a wakeup
          or a system event while processing the terminate event.
          If this is the case, the terminate event is followed by a
          <em>terminate canceled</em> event, as actual termination
          will not happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The runtime will avoid terminating an active, focused
          application if at all possible. However, the runtime can
          terminate the application as a last resort (e.g., due to
          resource exhaustion or bad behavior).
        </p>
        <p>
          The runtime prevents an application from interfering
          with the application's termination, e.g. event listeners or long-running
          scripts using APIs such as Geolocation, setTimeout, XMLHttpRequest will
          not block the runtime from terminating the application.
        </p>

        <h3>Application Events</h3>

        </p>
        <p>
          The runtime context associated with the <a>main document</a> can
          be launched and terminated either by the user, another
          application, or by the system. The system can decide to
          terminate an application as long as it is considered
          idle (no visible views or connected message ports).
          In the case the application received an event (or something
          similar, like a task was scheduled) while processing the
          <em>terminate</em> event, the <em>terminate canceled</em> event
          will be fired successively and the <a>main document</a> will stay
          active until considered idle again.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          Mozilla would like the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Simple_Push">

          in this spec].
        </div>
        <p>
          When the application is launched, the launch event is fired
          with a reason which can be of type <em>pending event</em>,
          <em>scheduled</em> or <em>other</em>. If the
          application was launched in order to handle an event it
          subscribed to or in response to a scheduled task, the type
          will be <em>pending event</em> and <em>scheduled</em>
          respectively. This allows for the application to avoid creating
          any user interface not resulting from the respective event
          handling.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          Explain how the <em>other</em> reason is handled
          by application developers.
        </div>
        <p>
          In the case the user or another application started the 
          application, the reason is set to <code>other</code>, allowing
          the main document to load the default user interface and
          potentially a “screenshot” of the application while the
          main user interface is being built in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
          For handling application lifecycle, the application's
          <a>main document</a> can listen to the events.

        <h2>System Events</h2>
        <p>
          This section is non-normative.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>system event</dfn> is an event sent by the system. This
          event type does not originate from the DOM itself and thus lives
          outside of the <a>main document</a>'s lifetime. A system
          event can wake up a terminated application.
          An implementation can also allow a system event to wake up
          the system from sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical browser-driven use case for system events is
          an email application that wants to show a desktop notification
          when a push notification is received so the user is informed that
          there are new emails even though the tab in which the email
          application was running has been closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          System events are applicable to event types that fire
          at low frequency and support filtering. For example, they are not
          appropriate for user interaction events that require a visible user
          interface or fire frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an application is launched in response to a system event,
          its <a>main document</a> is loaded, a launch event is dispatched,
          and immediately after the launch event, the system event handler is
          called. If the application did not register the listener as part
          of the launch event, nothing happens.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          To register for system events, need an event handler that is
          triggered when the application is first installed, the application
          is updated, or the runtime is updated to a new version
          ("oninstalled" or similar). Registration through the Manifest
          would be beneficial too.

            <h3>Filtered Events</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Filtered events are a mechanism that allows listeners to
              specify a subset of events that they are interested in.
              A listener that makes use of a filter is not invoked for
              events that do not pass the filter, which makes the listening
              code more declarative and efficient.

            <p>
              To prevent an application from being woken up for no reason,
              filtering happens in the runtime and not in an application.

        <h2>
          Requirements
        </h2>
        <p>
          Below is a summary of requirements derived from the above
          use cases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            An application (e.g. a background service) MUST be able
            to run without visible user interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            An application MUST be able to decide when to show the
            user interface, if at all. It is up to the application developer
            to decide when it is appropriate to show the user interface.
            <ul>
              <li>
                An application MUST be able to show the user interface
                only after it is fully constructed with the right dimensions
                and all the needed data has been loaded.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The runtime model MUST support authoring an application
            (or a service without user interface) that can be
            terminated without user’s consent, and that is able to
            restore to its previous state.
          </li>
          <li>
            After being launched, an application MUST be able to
            execute scripts to recreate its state before recreating
            the actual user interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            An application MUST be able to show a different user
            interface given how the app was launched.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For example, if launched as a photo picker, the
                application will not show the default application
                window, but instead creates a special purpose user interface.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The runtime MUST provide a mechanism to prevent an
            application from being launched unnecessarily.
            <ul>
              <li>
                As the system events can result in launching dormant
                apps, it is important that that only happens for subscribed
                events which support pre-filtering. For example, if an
                application listens to a "USB plugged"
                event, it can additionally ask to only listen to a specific
                device connected or a specific port.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The application MUST be able to enumerate windows
            associated with it, and create new windows.
          </li>
          <li>
            The application MUST be able to create a window and
            have it laid out correctly with the right dimensions
            before being shown.
            <ul>
              <li>
                This allows emulating the splash screen/application
                screenshot at launch for any screen size, before
                loading any application logic, so that the screenshot
                is not needed to be part of the manifest.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        Acknowledgments
      </h2>
      <p>Thanks to everyone who have contributed to the
        <a href="https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker">
        Service Worker</a> proposal that provides primitives
        for this specification to build atop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some use cases are derived from Adam Barth’s execution model
        proposal referenced in the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/09/sysapps-wg-charter.html">
        System Applications Working Group Charter</a>. Thanks to the
        Chrome team for their experiments with Packaged Apps. Also
        special thanks to Thiago Marcos P. Santos and Caio Marcelo
        de Oliveira Filho for their comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, big thank you to all SysApps Toronto participants who
        reviewed the proposal, sent feedback and participated in
        the task force session.
